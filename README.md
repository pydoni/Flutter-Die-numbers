# Die numbers

A project that helps in the german number listening, through a game with 3 leves of difficulty. I created this project as I was having some difficulty to get the number in german because they change the number orders.

# Used libraries

Flutter-tts : Text to speech library used to emit the numbers sounds
dart:math : Used to get the random function to generate numbers
